  Woke up today with a lay of the land
  Feather in cap and the sun in the sand
  It was easy
  It was easy to understand
  Everything suddenly falls out of sight
  Every attachment is made of the light
  That you offered
  You have offered to give me life
  
  CHORUS
  See the sky & all the land together again
  See the way the earth can stay below
  Who do we think we are?
  Everything plays a part
  There are some things we are never meant to know
  
  Having enjoyed all the meat from the bone
  Is perfectly equal to being alone
  It was even
  But you breathe and I turn to stone
  Everything suddenly looks like a sign
  Easy to see from the outermost clime
  I believe in what I leave in the way behind
  
  CHORUS
  
  And all the parts combine to one
  And all of us around the sun
  Everything will fall away
  To order from the disarray
  
  See the sun the shadows cast
  From all the times I floated past
  See the ocean spinning out
  With all the hope & all the doubt
  
  See the sky & all the land together again
  See the way the earth can stay below
  Who do we think we are?
  Everything plays a part
  There are some things we don't understand
  Reasons on the other hand
  There are some things we are never meant to know

  Love of the s*n
  Came back again to make it clear that
  He never said it would meet demand
  Shame on a martyr claiming friends from
  Either perspective of &
  Weak & Strong &
  Wet & Dry &
  Right & Wrong &
  Live & Die &
  Sane & Gone &
  Love & Not &
  All the &amp;s that we forgot so
  
  Sing while you hear it
  Don't deny it
  Leave if you can't stand the thought of it
  Come back again to make things stand with
  No disrespect to the &
