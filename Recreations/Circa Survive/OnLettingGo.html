<b>LIVING TOGETHER</b>

It starts out like a season in reverse
A way to set your mind above and over words
(Like) attached means (your) identity
Erases things so how can we record?
Distress call code-word is I wanna live
He makes it up as it goes and it goes away
To places he can only hide in other peoples minds
He makes it up as it goes,
Your rational mind's insane
Taste the sound you make
When the light from the sun
(Or the story that never gets sold)
Is your mother
With an effortless smile you pervade to be
Always in-between aisles
(They said you must stare to see)
An optimistic
Daring me, would you trade your soul for gold?


<b>IN THE MORNING AND AMAZING</b>

Infinite silence flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong and I cannot sleep without the radio on
You are in my dreams half human, half machine,
With someone else that I've felt and seen
I will not rest, or my conciousness contest-
Looking right through the lens from winter brings
the spring again
And infinite silence.
And we fall asleep with ties to mend so please
Let the cleaning begin with evolution
Hold my breath until communication is only just a test.


<b>THE GREATEST LIE</b>

This building smelled so familiar
And I had thought the sense was lost
And in a day dream I imagined my house
where all my father's sense of strength was lost
And it's all we have
So find me a place to begin.
If I could get this feeling to end
Trembling idle hand, holding me there.
<t style="letter-spacing:-1px;">We laugh in the face of love because nobody's really there.</t>
Nobody's real.
Desire I would try it either way,
and we believe in something
Invisible, the sense of smell that you use all your
life (well now you know your father lied)
I could never find my way without you,
but you're already there.
<t style="letter-spacing:-0.4px;">We've come a long long way without maps in our hands.</t>
It's all we have.


<b>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEDICINE
AND POISON IS IN THE DOSE</b>

Move one inch at a time
And don't make shit rhyme.
Would it be easy to repeat the first line?
My mind's not a well, it won't run dry
Just keep drinking water and you'll be alright
This is paralysis with no time at all to let go
Don't call me by my full name
All this is temporary, it feels much
Better to know that you won't feel a thing.
Don't talk about it.
Write it down but don't ask for help.
I can't be honest with even myself.
Did you ever wish you were somebody else?
Just lasting this long,
I feel relieved to let repitition save me
Unremittingly
(They pulled me in but) accomplishments are transient


<b>MANDALA</b>

Dance with me
For I'll be leaving soon
The afterbirth on the keypads overwhelm
"Did he who make the lamb make thee?"
Help me find its origin
In a cartoon house
In a cartoon car
There are cities buried underneath our cities
"Let the people be free" it's all around us
Let the people see we so obviously had another hand
And so separated
How can I feel or act like I've made this when I so
obviously had another hand.


<b>TRAVEL HYMN</b>

It came across like you were mad
Holding in your breath with everything you had
Until <t style="cursor:pointer;" title="It says you in the lyric book. I swear it isn't my mistake">you</t> face began to turn red
