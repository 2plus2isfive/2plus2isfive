        <span class="red">HELENA</span> LONG AGO. JUST LIKE THE HEARSE YOU DIE
        TO GET IN AGAIN. WE ARE. SO FAR FROM YOU. BURNING ON. JUST LIKE THE
        MATCH YOU STRIKE TO INCINERATE. THE LIVES OF EVERYONE YOU KNOW. AND
        WHAT'S THE WORST YOU TAKE. FROM EVERY HEART YOU BREAK. AND LIKE THE
        BLADE YOU STAIN. WELL I'VE BEEN HOLDING ON TONIGHT. WHAT'S THE WORST
        THAT I CAN SAY? THINGS ARE BETTER IF I STAY SO LONG AND GOODNIGHT. AND
        IF YOU CARRY ON THIS WAY. THINGS ARE BETTER IF I STAY. SO LONG AND
        GOODNIGHT. CAME A TIME. WHEN EVERY STAR FALLS. BROUGHT YOU TO TEARS
        AGAIN. WE ARE. THE VERY HURT YOU SOLD. CAN YOU HEAR ME? ARE YOU NEAR ME?
        CAN WE PRETEND TO LEAVE AND THEN. WE'LL MEET AGAIN. WHEN BOTH OUR CARS
        COLLIDE.

        <span class="red">GIVE 'EM HELL KID</span> OH BABY HERE COMES THE SOUND!
        I TOOK A TRAIN OUTTA NEW ORLEANS AND THEY SHOT ME FULL OF EPHEDRINE.
        THIS IS HOW WE LIKE TO DO IT IN THE MURDER SCENE. CAN WE SETTLE UP THE
        SCORE? IF YOU WERE HERE. I'D NEVER HAVE A FEAR. SO GO ON LIVE YOUR LIFE.
        BUT I MISS YOU MORE THAN I DID YESTERDAY. YOU'RE SO FAR AWAY. SO C'MON
        SHOW ME HOW. 'CAUSE I MEAN THIS MORE THAN WORDS CAN EVER SAY. YOU'RE
        BEAUTIFUL! WELL I'M A TOTAL WRECK AND ALMOST EVERY DAY. LIKE THE FIRING
        SQUAD OR THE MESS YOU MADE. WELL DON'T I LOOK PRETTY WALKING DOWN THE
        STREET. IN THE BEST DAMN DRESS I OWN? WE ARE YOUNG AND WE DON'T CARE.
        YOUR DREAMS AND YOUR HOPELESS HAIR. WE NEVER WANTED IT TO BE THIS WAY.
        FOR ALL OUR LIVES. DO YOU CARE AT ALL?

        <span class="red">TO THE END</span> HE CALLS THE MANSION NOT A HOUSE BUT
        A TOMB. HE'S ALWAYS CHOKING FROM THE STENCH AND THE FUME. THE WEDDING
        PARTY ALL COLLAPSED IN THE ROOM. SO SEND MY RESIGNATION TO THE BRIDE AND
        THE GROOM. LET'S GO DOWN! THIS ELEVATOR ONLY GOES UP TO TEN. HE'S NOT
        AROUND HE'S ALWAYS LOOKING AT MEN. DOWN BY THE POOL HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY
        FRIENDS. AS THEY ARE. FACE DOWN AND BLOATED SNAP A SHOT WITH THE LENS.
        IF YOU MARRY ME, WILL YOU BURY ME? WILL YOU CARRY ME TO THE END? SO SAY
        GOODBYE TO THE VOWS YOU TAKE. AND SAY GOODBYE TO THE LIFE YOU MAKE. AND
        SAY GOODBYE TO THE HEART YOU BREAK. AND ALL THE CYANIDE YOU DRANK. SHE
        KEEPS A PICTURE OF THE BODY SHE LENDS. GOT NASTY BLISTERS FROM THE MONEY
        SHE SPENDS. SHE GOT A LIFE OF HER OWN AND IT SHOWS BY THE BENZ SHE
        DRIVES AT 90 BY THE BARBIES AND KENS. IF YOU EVER SAY NEVER TO LATE.
        I'LL FORGET ALL THE DIAMONDS YOU ATE. LOST IN COMA AND COVERED IN CAKE.
        INCREASE THE MEDICATION. SHARE THE VOWS AT THE WAKE. KISS THE BRIDE. SO
        SAY GOODBYE TO THE VOWS YOU TAKE. AND SAY GOODBYE TO THE LIFE YOU MAKE.
        AND SAY GOOBYE TO THE HEART YOU BREAK. AND ALL THE CYANIDE YOU DRANK. SO
        SAY GOODBYE TO THE LAST PARADE. AND WALK AWAY AS THE PARTIES FADE. AND
        SAY GOODNIGHT TO THE HEART YOU BREAK AND ALL THE CYANIDE YOU DRANK. TO
        THE END.

        <span class="bold"><b>(ADDITIONAL VOCALS BY BERT MCCRACKEN)</b></span>
        IN THE MIDDLE OF A GUNFIGHT. IN THE CENTER OF A RESTAURANT. THEY SAY.
        COME WITH YOUR ARMS RAISED HIGH. WELL THEY'RE NEVER GONNA GET ME. LIKE A
        BULLET THROUGH A FLOCK OF DOVES. TO WAGE THIS WAR AGAINST YOUR FAITH IN
        ME. YOUR LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. ON YOUR MOTHER'S EYES SAY A
        PRAYER. SAY A PRAYER. NOW. BUT I CAN'T. AND I DON'T KNOW. HOW WE'RE JUST
        TWO MEN AS. GOD HAD MADE US. WELL I CAN'T. WELL I CAN. TOO MUCH TOO
        LATE. OR JUST NOT ENOUGH OF THIS. PAIN IN MY HEART FOR YOUR DYING WISH.
        I'LL KISS YOUR LIPS AGAIN. THEY ALL CHEAT AT CARDS AND THE CHECKERS ARE
        LOST. MY CELLMATE'S A KILLER. THEY MAKE ME DO PUSHUPS IN DRAG. BUT
        NOBODY IF YOU'RE LOSING MYSELF AM I LOSING MYSELF AND WILL. I MISS MY
        MOM! WILL THEY GIVE ME THE CHAIR? OR LETHAL INJECITON OR SWING FROM A
        ROPE IF YOU DARE. OH NOBODY KNOWS ALL THE TROUBLE I SEEN. LIFE IS BUT A
        DREAM FOR THE DEAD. AND WELL I CAN'T GO DOWN BY MYSELF BUT I'LL GO DOWN
        WITH MY FRIENDS. TAKE IT LIKE A MAN.

        <span class="red">I'M NOT OKAY (I PROMISE)</span> WELL IF YOU WANTED
        HONESTY THAT'S ALL YOU HAD TO SAY. I NEVER WANT TO LET YOU DOWN OR HAVE
        YOU GO. IT'S BETTER OFF THIS WAY. FOR ALL THE DIRTY LOOKS. THE
        PHOTOGRAPHS YOUR BOYFRIEND TOOK. REMEMBER WHEN YOU BROKE YOUR FOOT FROM
        JUMPING OUT THE 2ND FLOOR I'M NOT OKAY. YOU WEAR ME OUT. WHAT WILL IT
        TAKE TO SHOW YOU THAT IT'S NOT THE LIFE IT SEEMS. I'VE TOLD YOU TIME AND
        TIME AGAIN YOU SING THE WORDS BUT DON'T KNOW. WHAT IT MEANS. TO BE A
        JOKE AND LOOK. ANOTHER LINE WITHOUT A HOOK. I HELD YOU CLOSE AS WE BOTH
        SHOOK. FOR THE LAST TIME--TAKE A GOOD HARD LOOK. FORGET ABOUT THE DIRTY
        LOOKS. THE PHOTOGRAPH YOUR BOYFRIEND TOOK. YOU SAID YOU READ ME LIKE A
        BOOK. BUT THE PAGES ARE ALL TORN AND FRAYED. NOW I'M OKAY.

        <span class="bold"><b>(ADDITIONAL VOCALS By RINAT)</b></span> I NEVER
        SAID I'D LIE IN WAIT FOREVER. IF I DID WE'D BE TOGETHER. I CAN'T ALWAYS
        JUST FORGET HER. BUT SHE COULD TRY. AT THE END OF THE WORLD OR THE LAST
        THING I SEE. YOU ARE NEVER COMING HOME. COULD I? SHOULD I? AND ALL THE
        THINGS THAT YOU NEVER EVER TOLD ME. AND ALL THE SMILES THAT ARE EVER
        EVER. EVER. GET THE FEELING THAT YOU'RE NEVER. ALL ALONE AND I REMEMBER
        NOW. AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS IN MY ARMS. SHE DIES. SHE DIES. AT THE END
        OF THE WORLD. OR THE LAST THING I SEE. YOU ARE NEVER COMING HOME. COULD
        I? SHOULD I? AND ALL THE WOUNDS THAT ARE EVER GONNA SCAR ME. AND ALL THE
        GHOSTS THAT ARE NEVER GONNA CARCH ME. IF I FALL DOWN.

        KILLING JAR I'D SOMETIMES STARE FOR HOURS. SHE EVEN POKED THE HOLES SO I
        CAN BREATHE. SHE BOUGHT THE LAST LINE. I'M JUST THE WORST KIND OF GUY TO
        ARGUE. WITH WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND. AND FOR THE LAST NIGHT I LIE. COULD I
        LIE WITH YOU? GIVE UP. GET DOWN. IT'S JUST THE HARDEST PART OF LIVING.
        SHE WANTS. IT ALL.
