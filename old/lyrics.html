<pre>And we can run from the backdrop of these gears and scalpels
At every hour goes the tick-tock bang of monitors
As they stared us down when we met in the emergency room
And in our beds, I could hear you breathe with help from cold machines
Every hour
On the hour
They drew blood
Well, I felt I couldn't take (take) another day inside this place (this place)
From silent dreams we never wake (wake) and in this promise that we'll make
Starless eyes for heaven's sake, but I hear you anyway
Well, I thought I heard you say
"I like you, we can get out
We don't have to stay, stay inside this place"
Someday, this day, we kept falling down
Someday, this day, set the Ferris wheel ablaze
You left my heart, an open wound
And I love you for-
This day, someday (someday), we kept falling down
One day, this day, all we had to keep us safe
And if we never sleep again
It would never end
Well, I thought I heard you say to me
"We'll go so far, far as we can
And I just can't stay, one day we'll run away"</pre>
