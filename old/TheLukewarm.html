   <i>(The Lukewarm.)</i>
  <br>
  <br>
    Are you such a dreamer?<br>
    To put the world to rights?<br>
    I'll stay home forever<br>
    Where two &amp; two always<br>
    ⠀⠀makes up five<br>
    I'll lay down the tracks<br>
    Sandbag &amp; hide<br>
    January has April's showers<br>
    And two &amp; two always<br>
    ⠀⠀makes up five<br>
    <i>
    IT'S THE DEVIL'S WAY NOW<br>
    THERE IS NO WAY OUT <br>
    YOU CAN SCREAM &amp; YOU<br>
    CAN SHOUT<br>
    IT IS TOO LATE NOW
    </i><br>
    BECAUSE<br>
    YOU HAVE NOT BEEN<br>
    ⠀⠀PAYING ATTENTION<br>
    I try to sing along<br>
    I get it all wrong<br>
    Eezeepeezeeeezeepeeezee<br>
    NOT<br>
    I swat em like flies but<br>
    Like flies the buggers<br>
    Keep coming back<br>
    NOT<br>
    Maybe not<br>
    "All hail to the thief"<br>
    "But I'm not!"<br>
    "Don't question my authority<br>
    ⠀⠀or put me in the dock"<br>
    <i>
    Cozimnot!
    </i><br>
    Go &amp; tell the king that<br>
    The sky is falling in<br>
    When it's not<br>
    Maybe not.<br>
