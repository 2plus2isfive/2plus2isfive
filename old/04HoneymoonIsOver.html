    (Honeymoon is Over.)

  <br>
  <br>
    We're rotten fruit<br>
    We're damaged goods<br>
    What the hell<br>
    We got nothing more to<br>
    &#10240; lose<br>
    One gust &amp; we<br>
    Will probably crumble<br>
    We're backdrifters.<br>
    This far but no further<br>
    I'm hanging off a branch<br>
    I'm teetering on the brink<br>
    Oh Honeysweet<br>
    So full of sleep<br>
    I'm backsliding.<br>
    You fell into our arms<br>
    We tried<br>
    But there was nothing<br>
    We could do<br>
    <br>
    All evidence has been<br>
    &#10240; buried.<br>
    All tapes have been erased.<br>
    But your footprints<br>
    &#10240; give you away so<br>
    You're backtracking
